Convex is a stack-based golfing esolang based on Golfscript and CJam. Convex adds many new operators and removes many two-character operators.

**HUGE thanks to aditsu for [allowing me](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/28112803#28112803) to use the CJam codebase to get me started on this project!**

## Differences from CJam
The biggest difference from CJam is implicit input. Standard input will automatically be placed on the stack in a string form, or converts to list/number/block if applicable. Additionally, Convex uses the CP-1252 encoding, which allows for many more options for operators, meaning that many two-character operators can now be represented in one character. Finally, the other major difference is REGEX. Convex fully supports regex and regex functions.
